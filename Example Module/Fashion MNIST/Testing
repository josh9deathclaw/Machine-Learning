First Round :
  - 20 Epochs, Training Accuracy = 99%, Validation Loss = 0.4396 Accuracy = 92%
        - high validation loss is sign of overfitting
              - less testing ?
  - Model evaluation against the Test Set
  - Implement Dropout
        - randomly turns off a fraction of neurons during the training process
              - reduces dependency on the training set by some amount
                      - can decide how many neurons to turn off in the hyperparameters
